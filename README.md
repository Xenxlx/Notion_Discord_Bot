# Notion Reminder Discord Bot
**This project is meant to help me learn JavaScript through API interactions.** ***It will also be my first Discord bot.***

For now, it would only work with my Notion template or similar ones. 

## To-Do
- [x] Fetch the Notion schedule data & put it into a cleaner format to feed into the Discord bot
- [ ] Get the first iteration of the Discord bot up and running!
